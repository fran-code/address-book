# Address Book

The project is developed with React supported by Bootstrap for some components.

The project consists of three pages. From the first one we can enter records that will be stored in the localstorage. The second page lists this data. The third page allows us not only to display the data, but also to apply search criteria.

It can be started on port 3000 with the command:

### npm start

The tests are developed with RTL and Cypress. To run the unit tests we launch the command: 

### npm run test

For the end to end tests we run the command:

### npm run cy:open

This opens the Cypress interface and allows us to run the test.
